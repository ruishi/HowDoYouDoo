HowDoYouDoo
============
How Do You Doo is a game played on a show called Hollywood Game Nights. This program serves to make it easier to play a game by automatically fetching songs from the Billboard Hot 100 Chart and tracking the time and score for each team. HowDoYouDoo allows up to five rounds to be played.

Rules
-----
Players are split into two teams. 

The teams take turns and are each given two minutes.

The current team's leader is given a song and must sing the song using nothing but the syllable "doo." 

The rest of the team must try and guess the song. If they are correctly able to guess the song, then the team gets a point and the person who guessed must go up and sing another song for the team to guess. Repeat until the time is up.

Players are allowed to pass.
